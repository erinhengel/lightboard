  This study describes a small-scale lightboard pilot and build with accompanying at-home studio for an advanced undergraduate course in microeconomic theory taught at the University of Liverpool during the first term of the 2020â€“2021 academic year. This article will provide an overview of the lightboard literature in higher education, describe the author's experience constructing and teaching with a lightboard and report results from a survey of students on how they perceived learning with a lightboard. We believe our study will be useful to educators looking to implement a flipped classroom environment while dealing with the stay-at-home requirements imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
