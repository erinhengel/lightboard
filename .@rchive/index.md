**Abstract**. This study describes a small-scale lightboard pilot and build with accompanying at-home studio for a third-year course taught at the University of Liverpool during the first term of the 2020–2021 academic year. This article will provide an overview of the lightboard landscape in higher education, offer considerations for the construction of a lightboard, share the authors' experiences and outcomes and report the quantitative and qualitative results of a survey of students' experiences. We believe the result of our study will be useful to educators looking to implement a flipped classroom environment while dealing with the stay-at-home requirements imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a flipped classroom environment, all material on key content is made available to students to read and/or watch at their own pace at home. Face-to-face time with lecturers is then reserved for learning consolidation and identifying and addressing specific difficulties through 'active learning' exercises such as problem solving and discussion.

Although flipped classroom environments can be implemented using readings or audio podcasts, research suggests students are more likely to actually engage with and absorb the material when it is provided in video form. For example, @Halyo2013 found that students prefer watching videos to reading about the same material in a textbook. @Kao2008 used video podcasts in an engineering classroom setting; a follow-up survey of students' perceptions suggested that the vast majority found them helpful, especially because they allowed them to revisit the lectures when completing homework assignments. Other studies have reached similar conclusions (see, *e.g.*, @Itani2013 and @Beatty2019).

Evidence also suggests that allowing students to view videos at home in their own time improved student learning. For example, in the study by @Halyo2013 already mentioned, students were allocated into one of two types of classes: one in which they were asked to review a video during class and then engage in an active learning exercise and another where students reviewed the video at home before class. According to a perception survey, students would watch the video in more circumstances than would be possible from attending a classroom lecture. In a follow up study of the use of online video lectures in a more advanced course, @Halyo2013 also found that students particularly liked how watching video lectures before class freed up class time for problem solving interactively with the instructor. @Caviglia-Harris2016 investigated how using videos in a flipped learning environment impacted students' grades in an introductory microeconomics course. She found students in the flipped learning environment did significantly better on the final exam than students in an otherwise identical course that employed "traditional" lecture-based teaching methods.

# Lightboards

Although evidence has consistently shown that, when used in a well-designed flipped classroom, pre-recorded lectures can be an effective means of enhancing the learning environment, it is also not the case that all videos are created equal. In a large scale study of video engagement, @Guo2014 found that shorter videos, videos with talking heads and those that use Kahn-style tablet drawings are more engaging than providing voice-recordings over slides and even high quality pre-recorded classroom lectures. Similar results have also been documented elsewhere (see, *e.g.*, @Beatty2016).

Lightboards are one means of pre-recording lectures that takes advantage of Kahn-style tablet drawings *and* enables students to view the lecturer's head. The lightboard is a sheet of glass illuminated by light that, when written on using florescent pens, makes writing glow. The lightboard effectively combines writing on a whiteboard while facing his audience. For these reasons, it's thought to encourage more discussion and familiarity and is thought to make students more willing to participate in the learning experience, especially in a flipped classroom environment.

Given the lightboard is a relatively new technology, the use and evaluation of it in flipped classroom environments is limited. @Smith2017 assessed the impact of lightboard videos on students' perceptions of learning with a lightboard in a nutrition course. The qualitative feedback they analysed suggested that students found the lightboard videos more engaging and perceived having achieved a greater understanding of the material when they were used. @Rogers2019 intentionally interspersed lightboard videos with normal lectures in an undergraduate civil engineering course. They found students' performance on a weekly quiz was higher when they were exposed to lightboard videos as opposed to traditional face-to-face lectures. In an end-of-semester survey, students also reported finding the videos helpful for understanding the material, engagement and overall satisfaction. Other studies have found positive outcomes when students were asked to complete an assignment using the lightboard [@Hite2019](#).

A number of case studies exist describing the use and implementation of lightboards in specific contexts. For example, @Fung2017 describes a small-scale pilot implementation of the lightboard in an introductory chemistry course taught at the National University of Singapore. @Ye2016 discusses its implementation in the context of Chinese language instruction and provides a particularly detailed overview of the setup required and the advantages and disadvantages of the technology.  @McCorkle2020 present a detailed case study of small-scale lightboard pilot and full-scale lightboard build with accompanying studio used by faculty across a variety of faculties at a small, private liberal arts college in U.S.

The purpose of this study is to describe a small-scale lightboard pilot and build with accompanying at-home studio for a third-year course taught at the University of Liverpool during the first term of the 2020–2021 academic year. This article will provide an overview of the lightboard landscape in higher education, offer considerations for the construction of a lightboard, share the authors' experiences and outcomes and report the quantitative and qualitative results of a survey of students' experiences. We believe the result of our study will be useful to educators looking to implement a flipped classroom environment while dealing with the stay-at-home requirements imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Case study

## Course context

ECON342 is an advanced microeconomic theory course at the University of Liverpool. It is a required course in the Economics BSc and is usually taken during the first semester of the final year of their undergraduate studies.

ECON342 consists of three math-intensive modules. In the first module The jungle vs. the market", students are presented with two competing yet conceptually very similar methods of economic organisation: the so-called "jungle economy" and the more familiar "market economy". The second module is devoted entirely to a fuller appreciation of market exchange. In the third and final module, the course investigates equilibrium with asymmetric information. Topics include adverse selection, moral hazard and introduce agency theory.

Instructor-facilitated problem solving performed during class is the most effective way to learn maths-intensive economics courses. Unfortunately, it is performed at the expense of content coverage. Traditionally, ECON342 has put greater weight on the latter component relative to the former. Given the COVID-19 situation, however, the class was "flipped" in the first term of the 2020–21 academic year. In addition to enabling the course to meet stay-at-home requirements during the pandemic, "flipping" the classroom in this manner meant students could explore the lecture materials at their own pace outside of the seminar sessions and that freed up seminar sessions to reinforce learning through guided problem-solving activities. The end result, it was hoped, would be an increase in the more effective instructor-led problem-solving component of the course without simultaneously having to sacrifice content coverage.

An additional advantage of the flipped classroom environment was that it was thought to develop students' critical thinking skills as economists—and therefore prepare future economists to be productive members of their future profession (CITATION)—which is a key objective of ECON342.[^1] When economists reason, they often do so by analogy in the form of economic models. Economic models are powerful tools from which to draw conclusions based on the similarities between the models and real life. But they are expected to apply *only* when differences between real life and the assumptions of the model do not matter to the conclusions that are drawn. This is often a subtle and difficult concept for students' to appreciate. Importantly, it requires: (i) a lot of introspective effort on the part of students to understand and learn the basic building blocks of specific models; (ii) plenty of opportunities to clarify those mechanics and discuss interpretations one-on-one with class instructors; and (iii) space to collaborate with others on problem-solving together during group sessions. It was hoped that a flipped classroom environment involving lightboard videos would expand the scope provided to students of all three factors.

## Building the lightboard and recording studio

The cheapest lightboard that can be purchased "off-the-shelf" costs upwards of £1,000. I therefore decided to build my own lightboard using the instructions  provide by [Steve Griffiths](https://flippedlearning.org/how_to/how-to-make-a-lightboard-for-less-than-100/ "How to make a lightboard for less than $100"). The concept isn't very difficult. You just basically take a big sheet of glass, wrap LED lights around it and encase it in wood. See FIGURE for the final product.

But it's not just that you have to have a lightboard, you also need a dark room. Since I ended up spending more money building the lightboard than I had intended to, I tried to keep this element as cheap as possible. I therefore set up a studio in a guest bedroom. It includes black curtains behind but then you also have light the "talent" so you have to make sure everything is dark except the person doing the writing. That will make sure that everything is dark except for the writing and my face. This limits the number of things that can distract from the writing on the board or the instruction of the course. Given there are a lot of windows in my house, I found that the best time to film was late at night or early in the morning before the sun was up.

![The at-home lightboard studio](lightboard.png)

In order to spend the least amount of money possible, I used regular lighting I already had available at home. First, I attached a small book light to the top of the board to light my face. On the right-hand side I set up a free-standing anglepoise lamp and on the left-hand side I situated an anglepoise desk lamp on a stand about 3 feet off of the ground (FIGURE). The anglepoise lamps allowed me to mimic somewhat barn-door lighting—i.e., by focusing (to some degree) the light and limit it from bleeding out of the sides.

Besides the lighting, the camera is also important. There are always going to be scratches on the glass and in order to get rid of those, you need to adjust the aperture above 5.0 and make sure the shutter speed is 500. This requires a DSLR or bridge camera. This ensures you can't see the scratches and other imperfections on the glass.

The final component is a microphone. I just attached a small lapel mic to my iPhone and recorded using the inbuilt voice recorder. Post production, I then merge the recorded sound with the video.

## Post-production

As far as post-production, it's actually very easy. I initially used the 90-day trial version of Apple's Final Cut Pro because it was the only video editing software I was aware of. I ended up very much enjoy the postproduction component of making videos—and do far more than is necessary—and therefore eventually upgraded to the full version (£299). However, everything I describe in this section can be similarly done using free video editing software such as X. They include:
- flip the video so that the writing isn't backwards;
- add a sound compressor in order to improve the quality of a sound
- adjust the shadows a little big in order to eliminate entirely the larger scratches and smudges on the glass.
- Add an intro with some music—this is a benefit of using Final Cut Pro because it has a bunch of intros that are pre-packaged with the videos.
- There are times when I need to erase the board, so I speed that up so that students don't have to spend a minute and a half of watching me wipe it clean.
- Most video editing software will produce a very large file size so as a final step, I reduce the file size using the free software Handbrake.

## Result

In total, I made 38 videos for ECON342, X of them using the lightboard video. A sample lecture is available on YouTube: X.

# Feedback

## Methodology

Potential participants in this study include all third-year students on the Economics BSc course at the University of Liverpool. After completing their final exam, all students were invited to participate in an anonymous, voluntary, online survey. Students were sent X follow-up emails reminding them to fill out the survey, but no incentives were offered for completing it. In total, X students responded. The response rate was therefore X percent.

The survey consisted of X questions:
- Seventeen Likert-scale questions on student perceptions about the lightboard videos. These questions were separated into three broad categories: understanding, engagement and satisfaction and were adapted from a previously published survey (CITATION)
- Five open-ended, short answer questions on student perceptions about using the lightboard in a flipped classroom setting adapted from CITATION.
- X demographic questions on gender, course, etc.

## Results

Out of the total X undergraduate students enrolled in ECON342 during the first term of 2020–21, X students completed the perceptions survey. The low response rate was likely due to the fact that the survey was distributed during exam time and, after exam time, students were no longer paying attention to emails about ECON342.

# Discussion

The lightboard has several advantages to recommend it to lecturers looking to re-create their lectures in the face of COVID-19-related lockdown rules. The primary advantage is that, beyond the cost of designing the lecture, creating lightboard videos requires very little technical expertise and labour—and almost none if you video-record lectures through a mirror—to make lightboard videos. This means that the marginal cost of creating additional videos is very low, and therefore makes it an ideal solution for lecturers who have to create many videos in a short amount of time.

One of the big (personal) drawbacks I have found in having to pre-record lectures is that it is more difficult to sound enthusiastic without the presence of a live student audience. This is an important factor given studies show lecturer enthusiasm correlates positively with student evaluations (see, *e.g.*, @Murray1983, @Lindsay2002). Nevertheless, I found the novelty of creating videos with a lightboard made me more enthusiastic during recording sessions and that enthusiasm partially or even wholly compensated for what I must have lost from no longer having a live audience to react to.

There are several other benefits to the lightboard technology that recommend it for more general adoption even after the COVID-19-related stay-at-home orders are relaxed. First, the lightboard allows the lecturer to face the audience. This is thought to foster a more engaging and interactive experience with students (see, *e.g.*, @Guo2014). As discussed in @Ye2016, the lightboard requires that student engage their auditory and visual working memory simultaneously, which may increase working memory capacity more than using each in isolation [@Mayer1998](#) and the combination of audio and hand gestures may be especially effective [@Kelly2008](#).

Nevertheless, the lightboard is not appropriate in all circumstances. First and foremost, the lightboard is obviously not very relevant for courses that wouldn't use the whiteboard or chalkboard anyway—*e.g.*, courses which use very little maths or few diagrams. In this instance, the cost of building the lightboard and accompanying studio is unlikely to be justified by the benefits.

Relatedly, a second disadvantage is that lightboards are not trivial—or necessarily inexpensive—to build. In my own case, I purchased a router, table saw and several other items. The total cost of simply building a lightboard came to £X. Moreover, building the board required basic knowledge of carpentry (*e.g.*, knowing how to use a router to recess a channel to insert the glass). Depending on the thickness of the glass used, one may also need more than one person to help construct the lightboard and, in particular, position the glass properly into the wooden frame.

Having said this, there are several much easier ways to build a lightboard that work almost as well—and result in videos that look just as professional—as the lightboard I built. For example, instead of using glass and building a wood frame it, one can simply use plexiglass that has LED lights attached around the perimeter using clamps (see, for example, [Elisa Valkyria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1au1JxMSaA "How to build your own lightboard")'s tutorial).

The third and fourth drawbacks of the lightboard are that it (i) requires the lecturer to carefully plan the lecture in advance; and (ii) is not practical for long videos. The fundamental issue behind both issues is that there is only so much "real estate" on a lightboard available for writing. That is, if the video lasts longer than 5–10 minutes, then the instructor will likely have to clean the board while he is in the middle of filming—and cleaning a lightboard is a much more time consuming task than erasing a whiteboard or chalkboard. Although a small amount of post-production editing—e.g., cutting out the period when the instructor is cleaning the board or simply speeding it up—can eliminate the inconvenience for students, this may require more video editing skill than some users are willing to invest in obtaining.

Finally, lightboards cannot be (practically) deployed in most live classroom or even synchronous online environments. Although some professional lightboard setups exist that flip the instructor's handwriting in real time, thus allowing a live audience to experience the presenter's writing in reverse, they cost upwards of $10,000 (see, *e.g.*, @Ye2016).

### Best practice

Due to COVID-19, a significant portion of instruction in higher education has moved away from the traditional front-of-class lecture model to an active learning environment. In this paper, I have described how and why I adopted a lightboard to facilitate this. Based on my experience implementing the case student and the results of the student perception survey, I have identified the following best practices in integrating the lightboard into a flipped learning environment. 

1. **Use plexiglas**. Having used 10mm safety glass myself, I can say that if I were redoing my lightboard, I would simply use plexiglass. Although glass is clearer than plexiglas, it comes with several disadvantages. First, although 3mm picture glass is cheap and can be easily purchased from a picture framer, it can easily break. Thicker safety glass is the safer option, but it it is also substantially more expensive and extremely heavy. It is lightweight, cheap and can be easily purchased from your local hardware store. While plexiglass does scratch more easily than glass, I have found they can be easily removed by adjusting the exposure post-production.
2. **Film at night**. Lightboard videos look best if they are filmed against a black backdrop and the only light in the room is from the lightboard and optionally lights specially set up to illuminate the person speaking. Unfortunately, my own home has lots of windows. Instead of blacking out all of the windows in the room where I recorded the videos, I chose to film most videos at night. Early birds and night owls—or those (like me) who live closer to a pole and are filming in winter—may find this option similarly appealing. This has the added benefit of making it much easier to quickly take-down and reassemble the recording studio, which will be necessary if the room where you film your videos serves another purpose (e.g., a bedroom).
3. **Invest in professional lighting**. Basic lighting using anglepoise lamps work fine, especially when you invest a small amount of post-production effort in removing shadows, glare and scratches. The best setups, however, use professional lighting including two LED studio lights—with barn doors to make the backdrop completely black—one on each side of the lightboard, and a "hair light" to the top of the lightboard to illuminate your face.
4. **Buy a DSLR camera**. Although you don't need a DSLR camera, careful selection of the shutter speed and aperture will reduce smudges and, especially, increase the contrast with the colour. (And without these controls, keep in mind that viewers will have a hard time distinguishing between colours.)
5. **Exploit "fast-forward" post-production**. If you wipe the board while filming, I suggest speeding it up to 8x or 20x speed. It requires only a minimal amount of post-production effort and is less jarring than cutting out the portion entirely.
6. **Add an intro**. Adding an introduction with music and graphics is very easy to do with most video editing software—indeed, software like Adobe Premier Pro and Final Cut Pro come with a large number of introduction template generators that can be combined with short music clips to create a fun and attractive introduction to your videos.
7. **Apply a sound compressor**. Most video editing software has a function that emulates the sound and response of a professional-level analog compressor—e.g., the "the compressor effect" in Final Cut Pro. Applying custom or preset settings (e.g., "Vocal Compressor 01" in Final Cut Pro) will greatly enhance your audio by reducing background noise and increasing the volume of and brining into focus the sound of your voice.
8. **Shrink the video file**. Many video editing softwares produce gigantic video files. Reduce them to manageable size using freely available software such as HandBrake.
